    <h1>Welcome to our website!</h1>
    <p>We are a group of year two computer science students studying at the University of Dodoma, specifically in the College of Informatics and Virtual Education (CIVE). <br> Our team consists of Philes Philbert, Joseph Gabriel, Kapyela Eliah, Anuary Bakar, Daudi Joel, Pendo Mniko, Martha Mark, Suleiman Suleiman, and Erick Sangiwa. <br> We have come together with a common goal to provide valuable information about mental health through this platform.</p>
    <p>At our university, we are exposed to a wide range of computer science concepts and technologies, which has enabled us to create this informative website. <br> We believe that mental health is an important aspect of well-being that should be discussed and addressed more openly. We aim to share accurate and helpful information on mental health topics.</p>
    <p>Mental health is a subject that affects everyone, regardless of age, gender, or background. It is crucial to address mental health concerns, provide support, and educate individuals about available resources. <br> We hope our website can be your private space where you can access reliable information about various mental health issues, including anxiety, depression, stress management, and self-care techniques.</p>
    <p>Our team has conducted extensive research and collaborated with mental health professionals to ensure the accuracy and relevance of the information we provide. <br> We offer a range of articles and resources that cover different aspects of mental health. It is a website designed just for you.</p>
    <p>We understand that seeking help for mental health can be challenging for many individuals. Therefore, we have included a directory of helplines and support organizations that offer confidential assistance to those in need. We encourage you to explore our website and make use of the available resources.</p>
    <p>Thank you for visiting our website. We hope that the information we provide is exactly what you are looking for. Please don't hesitate to contact us. <br> Together, let's create a community that prioritizes mental well-being.</p>
