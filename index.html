                    <p>
                        Sleep isn't just a nonnegotiable for physical health. 
                        It also plays an essential role in mental health. 
                        In one study, researchers found that people who 
                        averaged 6 hours of sleep or less per night were 
                        about 2.5 times more likely to report frequent 
                        mental distress than those who averaged more than 
                        6 hours of sleep. The quality of your sleep matters, too. 
                        Disrupted sleep can contribute to mental health symptoms.

                            Exercise offers a range of mental health

                            and it doesn't have to mean going to the

                            Some foods can affect your mental health. 
                            Try including mind-boosting food in your diet. 
                            Examples of these foods include: berries, bananas, 
                            beans, whole grains, fatty fish, like salmon. 
                            It can also help to simply make sure you fuel your 
                            body every day by eating. Eating anything is better 
                            than eating nothing. Drinking plenty of water throughout 
                            the day can also have benefits. Certain foods, namely 
                            alcohol, caffeine, refined carbs, and added 
                            sugars, may worsen anxiety symptoms. So, limiting 
                            these foods can help ease some of your symptoms.

                            your room, setting a timer to clean something for 
                            just 5 minutes, buying a prepackaged meal when 
                            cooking anything feels close to impossible.Any similar 
                            approach you think you can try? Commit to taking
