                Mental Health refers to our emotional, psychological, and social well-being. It affects how we
                think, geel and act. It also helps determine how we handle stress, relate to others, and make
                healthy choices. Mental health is important at every stage of life.

                Mental and physical health are equally important components of overall health. Mental health
                problems such as depression increase the risk of some physical health problems, like diabetes,heart
                disease, and stroke. Likewise, the presence of chronic conditions can increase the risk of mental
                illness.

                <p>
                    Yes, it's important to rememeber that a person's mental health can change over time, depending
                    on many factors. When the expectations placed on a person exceed their resources and coping
                    abilities, their mental health could decline. For example, if someone is working long hours,
                    caring for a relative, or experiencng economic hardship, they may experience poor mental health.
