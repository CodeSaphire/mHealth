                    Sleep isn't just a nonnegotiable for physical health.
                    It also plays an essential role in mental health.
                    In one study, researchers found that people who
                    averaged 6 hours of sleep or less per night were
                    about 2.5 times more likely to report frequent
                    mental distress than those who averaged more than
                    6 hours of sleep. The quality of your sleep matters, too.
                    Disrupted sleep can contribute to mental health symptoms.

                    Reading a lot of information about other people's
                    lives on various social media websites or apps such
                    as Facebook, Instagram and Twitter may cause someone
                    to compare themselves and develop negative feelings
                    of low self-worth, which increases feelings of anxiety
                    and depression over information that may not
                    necessarily be true.

                    cultivating positive connections and nurturing
                    your friendships such as: Keep in touch by checking
                    in regularly, even with just a quick text or funny meme,
                    meet up for a morning walk or breakfast, call for a
                    short chat during your lunch break, schedule biweekly

                    Exercise offers a range of mental health
                    benefits, including: relieving stress,
                    lifting mood, helping you fall asleep
                    faster and sleep longer, helping you
                    manage symptoms of depression and
                    anxiety conditions. Movement can involve
                    something different for every person,
                    and it doesn't have to mean going to the
                    gym unless you genuinely want to. Instead,
                    make movement enjoyable for you by opting for
                    physical activities that work best for your body,
                    health, and preferences. Start by experimenting
                    with a range of physical activities and keep
                    doing the ones that resonate with you.

                    Some foods can affect your mental health.
                    Try including mind-boosting food in your diet.
                    Examples of these foods include: berries, bananas,
                    beans, whole grains, fatty fish, like salmon.
                    It can also help to simply make sure you fuel your
                    body every day by eating. Eating anything is better
                    than eating nothing. Drinking plenty of water throughout
                    the day can also have benefits. Certain foods, namely
                    alcohol, caffeine, refined carbs, and added
                    sugars, may worsen anxiety symptoms. So, limiting
                    these foods can help ease some of your symptoms.

                    On difficult days, you might find it tough
                    to do any of the above, which might make you
                    feel even worse. If so try being more compassionate
                    to yourself and apply strategies like: Organizing
                    your room, setting a timer to clean something for
                    just 5 minutes, buying a prepackaged meal when
                    cooking anything feels close to impossible.Any similar
                    approach you think you can try? Commit to taking
                    one small step every day.
