                <h3> Anxiety Disorder </h3>
                <p>
                    Anxiety affects everyone in different ways. Sometimes, the feelings of fear and dread(great fear or
                    worry) don't go away or get worse over time. Here, you can learn about anxiety, who it affects, and
                    how to manage it.
                </p>
                <h4> What is anxiety? </h4>
                <p>
                    Anxiety is your body's natural response to stress. It is a feeling of fear or worry about what is to
                    come. For example, going to a job interview or giving a speech on the first day of school may cause
                    some people to feel fearful and nervous.
                    But if your feelings of anxiety are extreme, last for at least 6 months, and are interfering with
                    your life, you may have an anxiety disorder.
                </p>
                <h4> What are anxiety disorders? </h4>
                <p>
                    It's normal to feel anxious about moving to a new place, starting a new job, or taking a test. This
                    type of anxiety is unpleasant, but it may motivate you to work harder and do a better job. Ordinary
                    anxiety is a feeling that comes and goes but doesn't interfere with your everyday life.
                    In the case of an anxiety disorder, the feeling of fear may be with you all the time. It's intense
                    and sometimes debilitating(making someone very weak).
                    This type of anxiety may cause you to stop doing things you enjoy. For example, it may prevent you
                    from entering an elevator, crossing the street, or even leaving your home in extreme cases. If left
                    untreated, the anxiety will keep getting worse.
                    Anxiety disorders are the most common form of emotional disorder and can affect anyone. But,
                    according to the American Psychiatric Association, women are more likely than men to receive a
                    diagnosis of an anxiety disorder.
                </p>
                <h4> What are the types of anxiety disorders? </h4>
                <p>
                    Anxiety is an important part of several different disorders. These include:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li> <b>Panic disorder.</b> This means you experience recurring panic attacks at unexpected times.
                    </li>
                    <li> <b>Phobia.</b> This is an excessive fear of a specific object, situation, or activity. </li>
                    <li> <b>Social anxiety disorder.</b> This is an extreme fear of being judged by others in social
                        situations. </li>
                    <li> <b>Obsessive-compulsive disorder.</b> This means you have recurring irrational thoughts that
                        lead you to perform specific, repeated behaviours. </li>
                    <li> <b>Separation anxiety disorder.</b> This means you have a fear of being away from home or your
                        loved ones. </li>
                    <li> <b>Illness anxiety disorder.</b> This is anxiety about your health (formerly called
                        hypochondria). </li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    In addition, many mental health and medical conditions may feature anxiety as a symptom. These
                    include:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li> <b> Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). </b> This is anxiety following a traumatic event.
                    </li>
                    <li> <b> Major depressive disorders. </b> A strong relationship exists between depression and
                        anxiety. </li>
                    <li> <b> Chronic disease. </b> Managing conditions such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease
                        (COPD) and diabetes may result in anxiety symptoms. </li>
                    <li> <b> Inflammatory conditions. </b> </li>
                    <li> <b> Substance use disorders. </b> many people with anxiety may try to self-medicate to help
                        manage their symptoms. </li>
                    <li> <b> Chronic pain. </b> Anxiety is often found in those with chronic pain disorders. </li>
                </ul>
                <h4> What are the symptoms of anxiety? </h4>
                <p>
                    Anxiety feels different depending on the person experiencing it. Feelings can range from butterflies
                    in your stomach to a racing heart. You might feel out of control like there is no connection between
                    your mind and body.
                    You may have a general feeling of fear and worry, or you may fear a specific place or event. In some
                    cases, you may experience a panic attack.
                    Symptoms of anxiety can include:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li> anxious thoughts or beliefs that are difficult to control </li>
                    <li> restlessness </li>
                    <li> trouble concentrating </li>
                    <li> difficulty falling asleep </li>
                    <li> fatigue </li>
                    <li> irritability </li>
                    <li> unexplained aches and pains </li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    Your anxiety symptoms might be different from those experienced by someone else. That is why it is
                    essential to know how anxiety can present itself.
                </p>
                <h4> What is a panic attack? </h4>
                <p>
                    A panic attack is a feeling of intense fear that comes on suddenly and peaks within 10 to 20
                    minutes. The initial trigger of the fear can be known or unknown.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The physical symptoms can mimic a heart attack. Once you're experiencing a panic attack, the
                    symptoms may get worse if you believe you may be having a heart attack or a mental health emergency.
                    Another common fear that may worsen a panic attack is the fear that you might be judged negatively
                    if you're having an attack in public.
                    Panic attacks can vary greatly, and symptoms may differ among individuals. In addition, many
                    symptoms of anxiety don't happen to everyone, and they can change over time.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Common symptoms of a panic attack include:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li> chest pain </li>
                    <li> feeling of choking </li>
                    <li> fear of losing control </li>
                    <li> a feeling of impending doom </li>
                    <li> sweating, chills, and hot flashes </li>
                    <li> shaking </li>
                    <li> numbness and tingling of hands, feet, or face </li>
                    <li> nausea or upset stomach </li>
                    <li> shortness of breath </li>
                    <li> fear of dying </li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    When you experience repeated panic or anxiety attacks, you may have a panic disorder.
                </p>
                <h4> What causes anxiety? </h4>
                <p>
                    Experts aren't sure of the exact cause of anxiety. But a combination of factors likely plays a role.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The causes of anxiety may include:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li> situations such as surgery or occupational hazard </li>
                    <li> first degree relatives with generalized anxiety disorder </li>
                    <li> other medical issues such as depression or diabetes </li>
                    <li> environmental concerns, such as child abuse </li>
                    <li> substance use </li>
                    <li> stress </li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    In addition, researchers believe that it stems from the areas of the brain responsible for
                    controlling fear and the storing and retrieval of emotional and fear-related memories.
                </p>
                <h4> Who is at risk of anxiety disorders? </h4>
                <p>
                    With each type of anxiety, there are different risk factors. But there are some general influences,
                    including:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li> <b> Personality traits. </b> This includes shyness and nervousness in childhood. </li>
                    <li> <b> Life history. </b> This includes being exposed to negative or stressful life events. </li>
                    <li> <b> Genetics. </b> Of those who have a diagnosis of anxiety, 25 per cent have a first-degree
                        relative who also has a diagnosis of anxiety. </li>
                    <li> <b> Other health conditions. </b> Thyroid problems and other health conditions can make you
                        prone to anxiety. </li>
                    <li> <b> Stimulants. </b> Consuming caffeine, specific substances, and medications can worsen your
                        symptoms. </li>
                </ul>
                <h4> Are there tests that diagnose anxiety? </h4>
                <p>
                    A single test can't diagnose anxiety. Instead, an anxiety diagnosis requires a lengthy process of
                    physical examinations, mental health tests, and psychological questionnaires.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Some doctors or healthcare professionals may conduct a physical exam, including blood or urine tests
                    to rule out underlying medical conditions that could contribute to the symptoms you're experiencing.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Several anxiety tests and scales are also used to help a doctor assess the level of anxiety you're
                    experiencing.
                </p>
                <h4> What are treatments for anxiety? </h4>
                <p>
                    Once you've received a diagnosis of anxiety, you can explore treatment options with a doctor.
                    But treatment can help you overcome the symptoms and lead a more manageable day-to-day life.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Treatment for anxiety falls into three categories:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li> <b> Medication. </b> Doctors prescribe antianxiety and antidepressant drugs. </li>
                    <li> <b> Complemental health techniques. </b> Mindfulness, yoga, and self-management strategies such
                        as stress management are ways to treat your anxiety using alternative methods. </li>
                    <li> <b> Psychotherapy. </b> Therapy can include cognitive behavioural therapy and exposure response
                        prevention. </li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    Meeting with a therapist or psychologist can help you learn tools to use and strategies to cope with
                    stress when it occurs.
                </p>
                <h4> What natural remedies are used for anxiety? </h4>
                <p>
                    Lifestyle changes can effectively relieve some of the stress and anxiety you may cope with every
                    day. Most natural “remedies” consist of caring for your body and participating in healthy activities
                    while eliminating unhealthy ones.
                </p>
                <p>
                    These include:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li> quitting smoking cigarettes if you smoke </li>
                    <li> avoiding caffeine </li>
                    <li> avoiding alcohol </li>
                    <li> eating a healthy diet </li>
                    <li> staying active and exercising </li>
                    <li> meditating </li>
                    <li> getting enough sleep </li>
                </ul>
                <h4> Anxiety and depression </h4>
                <p>
                    If you have an anxiety disorder, you may also be experiencing depression. While anxiety and
                    depression can occur separately, it's not unusual for mental health disorders to happen together.
                    Anxiety can be a symptom of clinical or major depression. Likewise, worsening symptoms of depression
                    can become triggered by an anxiety disorder.
                    You can manage symptoms of both conditions with many of the same treatments: psychotherapy
                    (counselling), medications, and lifestyle changes.
                </p>
                <h4> How to help children with anxiety </h4>
                <p>
                    Anxiety in children is natural and expected. According to the Centers for Disease Control and
                    Prevention (CDC), 9.4% of children and adolescents ages 3 to 17 have had a diagnosis of anxiety.
                    As children grow up, they should outgrow the worries and fears they felt when they were younger. It
                    may be considered an anxiety disorder if they're afraid to be away from their parents, exhibit
                    extreme fear, and other anxiety symptoms that interfere with their day-to-day lives.
                    Anxiety in children can also become chronic and persistent, with uncontrolled anxiety leading them
                    to avoid interacting with their peers or family members.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Symptoms of an anxiety disorder in children might include:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li> stomachaches </li>
                    <li> headaches </li>
                    <li> fatigue </li>
                    <li> feelings of fear </li>
                    <li> trouble sleeping </li>
                    <li> irritability </li>
                    <li> anger </li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    Anxiety treatment for children includes cognitive behavioural therapy (talk therapy) and
                    medications.
                </p>
                <h4> How to help teens with anxiety </h4>
                <p>
                    Teenagers may have many reasons to be anxious. Tests, college visits, and first dates all pop up in
                    these important years. But teenagers who feel anxious or experience anxiety symptoms frequently may
                    have an anxiety disorder.
                    Symptoms of anxiety in teenagers may include nervousness, shyness, isolationist behaviours, and
                    avoidance. Likewise, anxiety in teens may lead to unusual behaviours.
                </p>
                <p>
                    For example, they may act out, perform poorly in school, skip social events, and even engage in
                    substance or alcohol use.
                    In some teens, depression may accompany anxiety. Diagnosing both conditions is essential so that
                    their treatment can address the underlying issues and help relieve symptoms.
                    The most common treatments for anxiety in teenagers are talk therapy and medication. These
                    treatments also help address depression symptoms.
                </p>
                <h4> Anxiety and stress </h4>
                <p>
                    Stress and anxiety are related but different. Stress is a typical and healthy reaction to an
                    identifiable event that's making you nervous, such as an upcoming test, presentation, wedding, or
                    other major change in your life.
                    Stress will go away once the trigger goes away. Anxiety, on the other hand, persists beyond any
                    trigger and may exist without a known trigger. A person may need treatment for anxiety to go away.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Both anxiety and stress respond well to physical activity, good sleep hygiene, and a well-balanced
                    diet. But if your anxiety and stress don't respond well and you feel your day-to-day functioning is
                    impaired, a mental health professional can help you determine a treatment plan.
                </p>
                <h4> Physical symptoms of anxiety </h4>
                <p>
                    When you experience symptoms of anxiety, they can manifest as physical symptoms such as:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li> insomnia </li>
                    <li> headache </li>
                    <li> stomachache </li>
                    <li> excessive sweating </li>
                    <li> dry mouth </li>
                    <li> shaking </li>
                    <li> muscle aches and tensions </li>
                    <li> heart palpitations </li>
                    <li> tiredness </li>
                    <li> dizziness </li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    Neither stress nor anxiety is always bad. Both can provide you with a boost or incentive to
                    accomplish the task or challenge before you. But if these feelings become persistent, they can begin
                    to interfere with your daily life. In that case, it's important to get treatment.
                    The long-term outlook for people with untreated depression and anxiety includes chronic health
                    issues, such as heart disease.
                </p>
                <h4> Anxiety and alcohol </h4>
                <p>
                    If you're anxious frequently, you may decide you would like a drink to calm your nerves. After all,
                    alcohol is a sedative. In addition, it can depress the activity of your central nervous system,
                    which may help you feel more relaxed.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Some people with anxiety disorders abuse alcohol or other drugs regularly to feel better, creating
                    dependency and addiction.
                    It may be necessary to treat an alcohol or drug problem before doctors can address the anxiety. But
                    chronic or long-term use can ultimately worsen the condition.
                </p>
                <h4> Can foods treat anxiety? </h4>
                <p>
                    Doctors commonly use medication and talk therapy to treat anxiety. But lifestyle changes, such as
                    getting enough sleep and regular exercise, can also help. In addition, some research suggests the
                    foods you eat may have a beneficial impact on your brain if you frequently experience anxiety.
                </p>
                <p>
                    These foods include:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li> flax and chia seeds </li>
                    <li> tryptophan </li>
                    <li> magnesium </li>
                    <li> vitamin D </li>
                    <li> turmeric </li>
                    <li> fatty fish such as mackerel and salmon </li>
                </ul>
                <h4> Anxiety prevention </h4>
                <h4> Children and teens </h4>
                <p>
                    It's not known why anxiety develops in children and teenagers. But there are excellent public health
                    approaches that work to prevent the disorder, and they include:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li> suicide prevention </li>
                    <li> mental health programs </li>
                    <li> child maltreatment prevention </li>
                    <li> youth violence prevention </li>
                    <li> bullying prevention </li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    As parents, you can communicate openly and honestly with your child while ensuring they're making
                    healthy decisions.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In addition, in cases of children and teens experiencing anxiety in response to something happening
                    within their family or in their home, it's a good idea to get family therapy. This is important
                    especially because children and teens may not find it so easy to talk about their feelings or be
                    aware of their anxiety.
                </p>
                <h4> Adults </h4>
                <p>
                    There are many ways to prevent anxiety and its symptoms. Please see the below options:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li> <b> Speak with a doctor about your medications. </b> Regularly speaking with a doctor about
                        your medications' dosing, effectiveness, and side effects ensures any health condition is
                        treated adequately and monitored for any possible anxiety-related side effects. </li>
                    <li> <b> Therapy. </b> Speaking with a therapist can help you develop more effective ways to cope
                        with fears and stress that lead to anxiety. </li>
                    <li> <b> Support groups. </b> Speaking with others is an opportunity to share coping strategies and
                        experiences. </li>
                    <li> <b> Restrict caffeine. </b> Caffeine can worsen anxiety symptoms. </li>
                    <li> <b> Stress management and mindfulness. </b> Practising stress management and mindfulness
                        prevent strain. </li>
                    <li> <b> Avoidance. </b> Avoiding people, places, and situations can lessen your stress and anxiety.
                        But this would be a short-term strategy. In the long term, it's better if you get treatment so
                        you no longer need to avoid a trigger. </li>
                </ul>
                <h4> Endgame </h4>
                <p>
                    You can treat your anxiety with medication, psychotherapy, or a combination of the two.
                    But some people who have a mild anxiety disorder, or a fear of something they can easily avoid,
                    decide to live with the condition and don't get treatment.
                    Avoiding the trigger, however, can make anxiety worse in the long term. Treatment can help you
                    overcome the need to avoid a trigger.
                    It's important to understand that anxiety disorders can be treated, even in severe cases. Although
                    anxiety usually doesn't go away, you can learn to manage it and live a happy, healthy life.

                <h3> Depression </h3>
                <h4> What is depression? </h4>
                <p>
                    Depression is classified as a mood disorder. It may be described as feelings of sadness, loss, or
                    anger that interfere with a person's everyday activities.
                    It's also fairly common. Data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimates that
                    18.5 per cent of American adults had symptoms of depression in any given 2-week period in 2019.
                    Though depression and grief share some features, depression is different from grief felt after
                    losing a loved one or sadness felt after a traumatic life event. Depression usually involves
                    self-loathing or a loss of self-esteem, while grief typically does not.
                    In brief, positive emotions and happy memories of the deceased typically accompany feelings of
                    emotional pain. In major depressive disorder, the feelings of sadness are constant.
                    People experience depression in different ways. It may interfere with your daily work, resulting in
                    lost time and lower productivity. It can also influence relationships and some chronic health
                    conditions.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Conditions that can get worse due to depression include:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li> obesity </li>
                    <li> diabetes </li>
                    <li> cancer </li>
                    <li> cardiovascular disease </li>
                    <li> asthma </li>
                    <li> arthritis </li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    It's important to realize that feeling down at times is a normal part of life. Sad and upsetting
                    events happen to everyone. But if you're feeling down or hopeless regularly, you could be dealing
                    with depression.
                    Depression is considered a serious medical condition that can get worse without proper treatment.
                </p>
                <h4> Depression symptoms </h4>
                <p>
                    Depression can be more than a constant state of sadness or feeling “blue.”
                    Major depression can cause a variety of symptoms. Some affect your mood and others affect your body.
                    Symptoms may also be ongoing or come and go.
                </p>
                <h4> General signs and symptoms </h4>
                <p>
                    Not everyone with depression will experience the same symptoms. Symptoms can vary in severity, how
                    often they happen, and how long they last.
                    If you experience some of the following signs and symptoms of depression nearly every day for at
                    least 2 weeks, you may be living with depression:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li> thoughts of death, suicide, self-harm, or suicide attempts </li>
                    <li> chronic physical pain with no clear cause that does not get better with treatment (headaches,
                        aches or pains, digestive problems, cramps) </li>
                    <li> appetite or weight changes </li>
                    <li> difficulty sleeping, early morning awakening, or oversleeping </li>
                    <li> moving or talking more slowly </li>
                    <li> difficulty concentrating, remembering, or making decisions </li>
                    <li> decreased energy or fatigue </li>
                    <li> loss of interest in hobbies and interests you once enjoyed </li>
                    <li> feeling bothered, annoyed, or angry </li>
                    <li> crying a lot </li>
                    <li> feeling hopeless, worthless, and pessimistic </li>
                    <li> feeling sad, anxious, or “empty” </li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    The symptoms of depression can be experienced differently among males, females, teens, and children.
                    Males may experience symptoms related to their:
                </p>

                </ul>
                <p>
                    Children may experience symptoms related to their:

                </ul>
                <h4> Depression causes </h4>
                <p>
                    There are several possible causes of depression. They can range from biological to circumstantial.

                    Common causes include:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li> <b> Pain. </b> People who feel emotional or chronic physical pain for long periods are
                        significantly more likely to develop depression. </li>
                    <li> <b> Substance use. </b> A history of substance or alcohol misuse can affect your risk. </li>
                    <li> <b> Medical conditions. </b> Certain conditions may put you at higher risk, such as chronic
                        illness, insomnia, chronic pain, Parkinson's disease, stroke, heart attack, and cancer. </li>
                    <li> <b> Brain structure. </b> There's a greater risk for depression if the frontal lobe of your
                        brain is less active. However, scientists don't know if this happens before or after the onset
                        of depressive symptoms. </li>
                    <li> <b> Early childhood trauma. </b> Some events affect the way your body reacts to fear and
                        stressful situations. </li>
                    <li> <b> Family history. </b> You're at a higher risk for developing depression if you have a family
                        history of depression or another mood disorder. </li>
                    <li> <b> Hormone levels. </b> Changes in female hormones estrogen and progesterone during different
                        periods like during the menstrual cycle, postpartum period, perimenopause, or menopause may all
                        raise a person's risk for depression. </li>
                    <li> <b> Brain chemistry. </b> There may be a chemical imbalance in parts of the brain that manage
                        mood, thoughts, sleep, appetite, and behaviour in people who have depression. </li>
                </ul>
                <h4> Risk factors </h4>
                <p>
                    Risk factors for depression can be biochemical, medical, social, genetic, or circumstantial. Common
                    risk factors include:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li> <b> Medical illnesses. </b> Depression is associated with other chronic medical illnesses.
                        People with heart disease are about twice as likely to have depression as people who don't,
                        while up to 1 in 4 people with cancer may also experience depression. </li>
                    <li> <b> Substance misuse. </b> About 21 per cent of people who have a substance use disorder also
                        experience depression. </li>
                    <li> <b> Gender identity. </b> The risk of depression for transgender people is nearly 4-fold that
                        of cisgender people, according to a 2018 study. </li>
                    <li> <b> Vitamin D deficiency. </b> Studies have linked depressive symptoms to low levels of vitamin
                        D. </li>
                    <li> <b> Certain medications. </b> Certain drugs including some types of hormonal birth control,
                        corticosteroids, and beta-blockers may be associated with an increased risk of depression. </li>
                    <li> <b> Socioeconomic status. </b> Socioeconomic status, including financial problems and perceived
                        low social status, can increase your risk of depression. </li>
                    <li> <b> Genetics. </b> You have an increased risk of depression if you have a family history of it.
                    </li>
                    <li> <b> Sex. </b> The prevalence of major depression is twice as high in females as in males. </li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    The causes of depression are often tied to other elements of your health.
                </p>
                <h4> Treatment for depression </h4>
                <p>
                    You may successfully manage symptoms with one form of treatment, or you may find that a combination
                    of treatments works best.
                    It's common to combine medical treatments and lifestyle therapies.
                    Some forms of treatment like <b> Psychotherapy, Cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT), Dialectical
                        behaviour therapy (DBT), Psychodynamic therapy, Light therapy and Electroconvulsive therapy
                        (ECT) </b> are known to be effective.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Because depression can be linked to other health problems, your healthcare professional may also
                    conduct a physical examination and order blood work. Sometimes thyroid problems or a vitamin D
                    deficiency can trigger symptoms of depression.
                </p>
                <p>
                    It's important not to ignore the symptoms of depression. If your mood doesn't improve or gets worse,
                    seek medical help. Depression is a serious mental health illness with the potential for
                    complications.
                    If left untreated, complications can include:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li> self-harm </li>
                    <li> thoughts of suicide </li>
                    <li> social isolation </li>
                    <li> relationship problems </li>
                    <li> panic attacks </li>
                    <li> substance use disorder </li>
                    <li> physical pain </li>
                    <li> weight gain or loss </li>
                </ul>
                <h4> Types of depression </h4>
                <ul>
                    <li> Major depressive disorder </li>
                    <li> Persistent depressive disorder </li>
                    <li> Postpartum depression </li>
                </ul>
                <h4> Depression and anxiety </h4>
                <p>
                    Depression and anxiety can occur in a person at the same time. Research has shown that over 70 per
                    cent of people with depressive disorders also have symptoms of anxiety.
                    Though they're thought to be caused by different things, depression and anxiety can produce several
                    similar symptoms.
                </p>
                <h4> Depression and obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) </h4>
                <p>
                    Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) is a type of anxiety disorder. It causes unwanted and repeated
                    thoughts, urges, and fears (obsessions).
                    These fears cause you to act out repeated behaviours or rituals (compulsions) that you hope will
                    ease the stress caused by the obsessions.
                    People diagnosed with OCD frequently find themselves in a loop of obsessions and compulsions. If you
                    have these behaviours, you may feel isolated because of them. This can lead to withdrawal from
                    friends and social situations, which can increase your risk for depression.
                    It's not uncommon for someone with OCD to also have depression. Having one anxiety disorder can
                    increase your odds of having another. Up to 80 per cent of people with OCD also have depression
                    episodes.
                    This dual diagnosis is a concern with children, too. Their compulsive behaviours, which may be first
                    developing at a young age, can make them feel unusual. That can lead to withdrawing from friends and
                    can increase the chance of a child developing depression.
                </p>
                <h4> Depression with psychosis </h4>
                <p>
                    Some individuals who have been diagnosed with major depression may also have symptoms of another
                    mental disorder called psychosis. When the two conditions occur together, it's known as “major
                    depressive disorder, severe with psychotic features,” or depressive psychosis.
                    Depressive psychosis causes people to see, hear, believe, or smell things that aren't real. People
                    with the condition may also experience feelings of sadness, hopelessness, and irritability.
                    The combination of the two conditions is particularly dangerous. That's because someone with
                    depressive psychosis may experience delusions that cause them to have thoughts of suicide or to take
                    unusual risks.
                    It's unclear what causes these two conditions or why they can occur together, but treatment can
                    successfully ease symptoms.
                </p>
                <h4> Depression in pregnancy </h4>
                <p>
                    Pregnancy is often an exciting time for people. However, it can still be common for a pregnant woman
                    to experience depression.
                    Symptoms of depression during pregnancy include:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li> thoughts of death or suicide </li>
                    <li> sleep problems, including insomnia or sleeping too much </li>
                    <li> troubles concentrating or remembering </li>
                    <li> persistent sadness </li>
                    <li> losing interest in activities and things you previously enjoyed </li>
                    <li> anxiety </li>
                    <li> feeling hopeless </li>
                    <li> changes in appetite or eating habits </li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    Treatment for depression during pregnancy may focus entirely on talk therapy and other natural
                    treatments.
                    While some women do take antidepressants during their pregnancy, it's not clear which ones are the
                    safest. Your healthcare provider may encourage you to try an alternative option until after the
                    birth of your baby.
                    The risks for depression can continue after the baby arrives. Postpartum depression, which is also
                    called major depressive disorder with peripartum onset, is a serious concern for new mothers.
                </p>
                <h4> Depression and alcohol </h4>
                <p>
                    Research has established a link between alcohol use and depression. People who have depression are
                    more likely to misuse alcohol.
                    Out of the 20.2 million U.S. adults who experienced a substance use disorder, about 50 per cent had
                    a co-occurring mental illness.
                    Drinking alcohol frequently can make symptoms of depression worse, and people who have depression
                    are more likely to misuse alcohol or become dependent on it.
                    Preventing depression
                    Depression isn't generally considered to be preventable. It's hard to recognize what causes it,
                    which means preventing it is more difficult.
                </p>
                <h4> Endgame </h4>
                <p>
                    Depression can be temporary, or it can be a long-term challenge. Treatment doesn't always make your
                    depression go away completely.
                    However, treatment often makes symptoms more manageable. Managing symptoms of depression involves
                    finding the right combination of medications and therapies.
                    If one treatment doesn't work, talk with your healthcare professional. They can help you create a
                    different treatment plan that may work better in helping you manage your condition.

                <h3> Bipolar Disorder </h3>
                <p>
                    Bipolar disorder is a mental health condition marked by large shifts in mood from mania to
                    depression. Although bipolar disorder can be challenging, many effective treatments and strategies
                    are available.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Bipolar disorder isn't a rare condition. The National Institute of Mental Health says that 2.8% of
                    U.S. adults — or about 5 million people — have a bipolar disorder diagnosis.
                    The condition used to be known as manic depression and bipolar disease.
                    Key symptoms of bipolar disorder include:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li> episodes of <b> mania </b> , or extremely elevated mood </li>
                    <li> episodes of <b> depression </b> , or low mood </li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    These episodes may last from a few days to several weeks or longer.
                </p>
                <h4> Types of bipolar disorder </h4>
                <p>
                    There are three main types of bipolar disorder: bipolar I, bipolar II, and cyclothymia.
                </p>
                <h4> Bipolar I </h4>
                <p>
                    Bipolar I is defined by the appearance of at least one manic episode. You may experience hypomanic
                    episodes, which are less severe than manic episodes, or major depressive periods before and after
                    the manic episode. A person can also go through a long period of stable mood before experiencing
                    either mania or depression.
                    This type of bipolar disorder affects people of all sexes equally.
                </p>
                <h4> Bipolar II </h4>
                <p>
                    People with bipolar II experience one major depressive episode that lasts at least 2 weeks. They
                    also have at least 1 hypomanic episode that lasts about 4 days. According to a 2017 review, this
                    type of bipolar disorder may be more common in females.
                </p>
                <h4> Cyclothymia </h4>
                <p>
                    People with cyclothymia experience some symptoms of hypomania and depression, but not enough to
                    characterize an episode of hypomania or depression.
                    These episodes also involve symptoms that are shorter and less severe than the episodes associated
                    with bipolar I or bipolar II disorder. Most people with this condition experience no mood symptoms
                    for 1 to 2 months at a time.
                    Your doctor can explain more about what kind of bipolar disorder you have when discussing your
                    diagnosis.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Some people experience distinct mood symptoms that resemble but don't align with these three types.
                    If that's the case for you, you might get a diagnosis of:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li> unspecified bipolar and related disorders </li>
                    <li> other specified bipolar and related disorders </li>
                </ul>
                <h4> Bipolar disorder symptoms </h4>
                <p>
                    To receive a diagnosis of bipolar disorder, you must experience at least one period of mania or
                    hypomania.
                    These both involve feelings of excitement, impulsivity, and high energy, but hypomania is considered
                    less severe than mania. Mania symptoms can affect your day-to-day life at work or home. Hypomania
                    symptoms typically don't cause as much disruption, but they can still be distressing.
                    Some people living with bipolar disorder also experience major depressive episodes or “down” moods.
                </p>
                <p>
                    These three main symptoms — mania, hypomania, and depression — are the main features of bipolar
                    disorder. Different types of bipolar disorder involve different combinations of these symptoms.
                </p>
                <h4> Bipolar I Symptoms </h4>
                <p>
                    According to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 5th edition (DSM-5), a
                    diagnosis of bipolar I disorder requires the following:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li> symptoms that don't relate to another medical or mental health condition or substance use </li>
                    <li> symptoms that affect daily function </li>
                    <li> at least one episode of mania that lasts at least 1 week </li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    You could also experience symptoms of psychosis or both mania and depression (known as mixed
                    features). These symptoms can have more impact on your life. If you have them, it's worth reaching
                    out for professional support as soon as possible.
                    While you don't need to experience episodes of hypomania or depression to receive a bipolar I
                    diagnosis, many people with bipolar I do report these symptoms.
                </p>
                <h4> Bipolar II symptoms </h4>
                <p>
                    A diagnosis of bipolar II requires:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li> symptoms that don't relate to another medical or mental health condition or substance use </li>
                    <li> at least one episode of major depression involving five or more key depression symptoms that
                        have a significant impact on your day-to-day life </li>
                    <li> at least one episode of major depression that lasts 2 weeks or longer </li>
                    <li> hypomania-related changes in mood and usual function that others can notice, though these may
                        not necessarily affect your daily life </li>
                    <li> at least one episode of hypomania that lasts 4 days or longer and involves 3 or more symptoms
                        of hypomania </li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    Bipolar II can also involve symptoms of psychosis, but only during an episode of depression. You
                    could also experience mixed mood episodes, which means you'll have symptoms of depression and
                    hypomania simultaneously. With bipolar II, though, you won't experience mania. If you have a manic
                    episode, you'll receive a diagnosis of bipolar I.
                </p>
                <h4> Cyclothymia symptoms </h4>
                <p>
                    A diagnosis of cyclothymia requires:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li> symptoms that cause significant distress and affect daily life </li>
                    <li> symptoms that don't relate to another medical or mental health condition or substance use </li>
                    <li> symptoms that are present for at least half of the 2 years and never absent for longer than 2
                        months at a time </li>
                    <li> symptoms that never meet the full criteria for an episode of hypomania or depression </li>
                    <li> periods of hypomanic symptoms and periods of depression symptoms, off and on, over 2 years or
                        longer (1 year for children and adolescents) </li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    Fluctuating mood symptoms characterize cyclothymia. These symptoms may be less severe than those of
                    bipolar I or II. Still, they tend to last longer, so you'll generally have less time when you
                    experience no symptoms.
                    Hypomania may not have a big impact on your daily life. Depression, on the other hand, often leads
                    to more serious distress and affects day-to-day function, even if your symptoms don't qualify for a
                    major depressive episode.
                    If you do experience enough symptoms to meet the criteria for a hypomanic or depressive episode,
                    your diagnosis will likely change to another type of bipolar disorder or major depression, depending
                    on your symptoms.
                </p>
                <h4> Mania and hypomania </h4>
                <p>
                    An episode of mania often involves an emotional high. You might feel excited, impulsive, euphoric,
                    and full of energy. You might also feel jumpy or notice your thoughts seem to race. Some people also
                    experience hallucinations and other symptoms of psychosis.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Manic episodes can involve behaviour that's more impulsive than usual, often because you feel
                    invincible or untouchable. Commonly cited examples of this kind of behaviour include:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li> going on spending sprees </li>
                    <li> misusing alcohol and drugs </li>
                    <li> having sex without using a barrier method </li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    But impulsiveness can also show up in plenty of other ways. Maybe you:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li> participate in extreme sports you wouldn't ordinarily consider </li>
                    <li> drive much faster than usual, well above the speed limit </li>
                    <li> make a big investment on a whim </li>
                    <li> take off on a road trip by yourself without telling anyone </li>
                    <li> quit your job abruptly </li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    While there are many reasons why a person might engage in these behaviours, the key to mania is that
                    these are not things you would choose to engage in periods of stable mood.
                    Hypomania, generally associated with bipolar II disorder, involves many of the same symptoms, though
                    they're less severe. Unlike mania, hypomania often doesn't lead to consequences at work, school, or
                    in your relationships. Episodes of hypomania don't involve psychosis. They typically won't last as
                    long as episodes of mania or require inpatient care.
                    With hypomania, you might feel very productive and energized, but you may not notice other changes
                    in your mood. People who don't know you well may not, either. Those closest to you, however, will
                    usually pick up on your shifting mood and energy levels.
                </p>
                <h4> Major depressive episodes </h4>
                <p>
                    A “down” change in mood can leave you feeling lethargic, unmotivated, and sad.
                    Bipolar-related episodes of major depression will involve at least five of these symptoms:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li> changes in appetite or weight </li>
                    <li> thoughts of death, dying, or suicide </li>
                    <li> trouble concentrating, focusing, and making decisions </li>
                    <li> a sense of guilt or worthlessness </li>
                    <li> periods of too little or too much sleep </li>
                    <li> lack of interest in activities you once enjoyed </li>
                    <li> a sense of feeling slower than usual or persistent restlessness </li>
                    <li> loss of energy </li>
                    <li> a lasting low mood marked by deep sadness, hopelessness, or feelings of emptiness </li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    Not everyone with bipolar disorder experiences major depressive episodes, though many people do.
                    Depending on your type of bipolar disorder, you might experience only a few symptoms of depression
                    but not the full five needed for a significant episode.
                    It's also worth noting that sometimes, but not always, the euphoria of mania can feel enjoyable.
                    Once you get treatment for mania, the symptom-free mood you experience might feel more like a “down”
                    shift, or a period of depression, than a more typical mood state.
                    While bipolar disorder can cause a depressed mood, bipolar disorder and depression have one major
                    difference. With bipolar disorder, you might have “up” and “down” mood states. With depression,
                    though, your mood and emotions might remain “down” until you get treatment.
                </p>
                <h4> Bipolar disorder treatment </h4>
                <p>
                    Several treatments can help you manage bipolar disorder symptoms. These include medications,
                    counselling, and lifestyle measures. Some natural remedies can also have benefits.
                </p>
                <h4> Causes and risk factors </h4>
                <p>
                    Bipolar disorder is a fairly common mental health condition, but experts have yet to determine why
                    some people develop the condition.
                    Some potential causes of bipolar disorder include:
                </p>
                <h4> Genetics </h4>
                <p>
                    If your parent or sibling has bipolar disorder, you're more likely to develop the condition. The
                    risk of developing bipolar disorder is 10% to 25% if one of your parents has the condition.
                    Keep in mind, though, that most people who have a history of bipolar disorder in their family
                    history don't develop it.
                </p>
                <h4> Your brain </h4>
                <p>
                    Your brain structure may affect your risk of developing bipolar disorder. Irregularities in brain
                    chemistry, or the structure or functions of your brain, may increase this risk.
                </p>
                <h4> Environmental factors </h4>
                <p>
                    It's not just what's in your body that can affect your chances of developing bipolar disorder.
                    Outside factors can also play a part. These might include:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li> physical illness </li>
                    <li> traumatic experiences </li>
                    <li> extreme stress </li>
                </ul>
                <h4> Can you prevent bipolar disorder? </h4>
                <p>
                    Once you begin to experience mood episodes, you can take steps to help reduce the severity of those
                    episodes and lower your chances of experiencing additional mood episodes. But you can’t always
                    prevent mood episodes entirely or keep the condition from developing in the first place.
                    Future research may reveal more about the specific causes of bipolar disorder and give researchers
                    more insight into potential ways of preventing the condition.
                </p>
                <h4> Common co-occurring conditions </h4>
                <p>
                    Some people living with bipolar disorder also have other mental health conditions. A 2019 research
                    review suggests that anxiety disorders are among the most common.
                    Other conditions that might occur alongside bipolar disorder include:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li> ADHD(Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder) </li>
                    <li> specific phobia </li>
                    <li> eating disorders </li>
                    <li> substance use disorders </li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    Symptoms of these conditions might show up more severely depending on your mood state. Anxiety, for
                    example, tends to happen more commonly with depression, while substance use might be more likely
                    with mania.
                    If you have bipolar disorder, you may also have a higher chance of developing certain medical
                    conditions, including:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li> migraine </li>
                    <li> heart disease </li>
                    <li> diabetes </li>
                    <li> thyroid disorders </li>
                </ul>
                <h4> Tips for coping and support </h4>
                <p>
                    If you've noticed symptoms of bipolar disorder, a good first step involves reaching out to a doctor
                    or therapist as soon as possible.
                    Similarly, if a friend or loved one has symptoms, consider encouraging them to connect with a
                    therapist as soon as possible. It never hurts to remind them that they have your understanding and
                    support.
                </p>
                <h4> Living with bipolar disorder </h4>
                <p>
                    Treatment can help you manage mood episodes and cope with the symptoms they cause.
                    Creating a care team can help you get the most out of treatment. Your team might involve:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li> a bipolar disorder support group or community of other people also living with bipolar disorder
                    </li>
                    <li> other professionals or specialists, such as a sleep specialist, acupuncturist, or massage
                        therapist </li>
                    <li> a therapist or counsellor who provides talk therapy </li>
                    <li> a psychiatrist who manages your medications </li>
                    <li> your primary doctor </li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    You may need to try a few treatments before you find one that leads to improvement. Some medications
                    work well for some people but not others. In a similar vein, some people find CBT very helpful,
                    while others may see little improvement.
                    It's always best to be open with your care team about what works and what doesn't. If something
                    doesn't help or makes you feel even worse, don't hold back from letting them know. Your mental
                    health matters and your care team should always support you in finding the most helpful approach.
                    A little self-compassion can go a long way, too. Remember that bipolar disorder, like any other
                    mental health condition, didn't happen by choice. It's not caused by anything you did or didn't do.
                    It's OK (and pretty common) to feel frustrated when treatment doesn't seem to work. Try to have
                    patience and treat yourself kindly as you explore new approaches.
                </p>
                <h4> Bipolar disorder and relationships </h4>
                <p>
                    Bipolar disorder can affect your relationships. But these effects might appear most clearly in your
                    closest relationships, like those with family members and romantic partners.When it comes to
                    managing a relationship while living with bipolar disorder, honesty can always help. Being open
                    about your condition can help your partner better understand your symptoms and how they can offer
                    support.
                    You might consider starting with a few basic details, including:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li> how long you've had the condition </li>
                    <li> how episodes of depression usually affect you </li>
                    <li> anything they can do to help </li>
                    <li> your treatment approach, including therapy, medication, and coping strategies </li>
                    <li> how episodes of mania usually affect you </li>
                </ul>
                <h4> Endgame </h4>
                <p>
                    Bipolar disorder is a lifelong condition, but that doesn't mean it has to completely disrupt your
                    life. While living with bipolar disorder certainly creates some challenges, sticking with your
                    treatment plan, practising regular self-care, and leaning on your support system can boost your
                    overall well-being and keep symptoms to a minimum.
                    Educating yourself and your loved ones about the condition can also have a lot of benefits.

                <h3> Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) </h3>
                <p>
                    Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a mental health disorder that begins after a traumatic
                    event. That event may involve a real or perceived threat of injury or death.
                    This can include:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li> an accident </li>
                    <li> physical or sexual abuse </li>
                    <li> physical or sexual violence </li>
                    <li> military combat </li>
                    <li> a natural disaster like an earthquake or tornad </li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    People with PTSD often feel a heightened sense of danger. Their natural fight-or-flight response is
                    altered, causing them to feel stressed or fearful, even when they're in a safe situation.
                    PTSD used to be called “shell shock” or “battle fatigue” because it often affects war veterans.
                    According to the National Center for PTSD, it's estimated that about 15 per cent of Vietnam War
                    veterans and 12 per cent of Gulf War veterans have PTSD.
                    But PTSD can happen to anyone at any age. It occurs as a response to chemical and neuronal changes
                    in the brain after exposure to threatening events. Having PTSD does not mean you're flawed or weak.
                </p>
                <h4> PTSD symptoms </h4>
                <p>
                    PTSD can disrupt your normal activities and your ability to function. Words, sounds, or situations
                    that remind you of trauma can trigger your symptoms.
                    Symptoms of PTSD fall into four groups:
                </p>
                <h4> Intrusion </h4>
                <ul>
                    <li> intense mental or physical distress when you think about the event </li>
                    <li> frequent nightmares about the event </li>
                    <li> vivid, unpleasant memories of the event infiltrating seemingly unrelated thoughts or memories
                    </li>
                    <li> flashbacks where you feel like you relive the event over and over </li>
                </ul>
                <h4> Avoidance </h4>
                <p>
                    Avoidance, as the name implies, means avoiding people, places, or situations that remind you of the
                    traumatic event
                </p>
                <h4> Arousal and reactivity </h4>
                <ul>
                    <li> bouts of anger </li>
                    <li> irritability </li>
                    <li> a constant feeling of being on edge </li>
                    <li> startling easily and having an exaggerated response when you're startled </li>
                    <li> trouble concentrating </li>
                </ul>
                <h4> Cognition and mood </h4>
                <ul>
                    <li> reduced interest in activities you once loved </li>
                    <li> trouble remembering important parts of the event </li>
                    <li> distorted feelings of guilt, worry, or blame </li>
                    <li> negative thoughts about yourself </li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    In addition, people with PTSD may experience depression and panic attacks.
                    Panic attacks can cause symptoms like:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li> headaches </li>
                    <li> a racing or pounding heart </li>
                    <li> fainting </li>
                    <li> lightheadedness </li>
                    <li> dizziness </li>
                    <li> agitation </li>
                </ul>
                <h4> PTSD treatment </h4>
                <p>
                    If you're diagnosed with PTSD, your healthcare professional will likely prescribe therapy,
                    medication, or a combination of the two treatments.
                    Cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) or “talk therapy” encourages you to process the traumatic event
                    and change the negative thinking patterns linked to it.
                    In exposure therapy, you re-experience elements of the trauma in a safe environment. This can help
                    desensitize you to the event and reduce your symptoms.
                    Antidepressants, anti-anxiety drugs, and sleep aids may help relieve symptoms of depression and
                    anxiety. Two antidepressants are FDA-approved to treat PTSD: sertraline (Zoloft) and paroxetine
                    (Paxil).
                </p>
                <h4> PTSD causes </h4>
                <p>
                    PTSD can develop in people who've been through or witnessed a traumatic event like a natural
                    disaster, military combat, or assault. While not everyone who experiences one of these events will
                    develop PTSD, research is revealing that trauma may cause actual changes to the brain.
                    For example, a 2018 study suggests people with PTSD have a smaller hippocampus — an area of the
                    brain involved in memory and emotion.
                    However, it's unknown whether they had a smaller hippocampal volume before the trauma or if the
                    trauma caused a decrease in hippocampal volume.
                    More research is needed in this area. People diagnosed with PTSD may also have abnormal levels of
                    stress hormones, which may set off an overreactive fight-or-flight response.
                    Additionally, some people may be more adept at managing stress than others.
                    While certain factors seem to protect against the development of PTSD, there is nothing “wrong” or
                    “broken” in people who develop it.

                <h4> Medical PTSD </h4>
                <p>
                    A life-threatening medical emergency can be just as traumatic as a natural disaster or violence.
                    A study from 2018 found that about 1 in 8 people who have a heart attack develop PTSD afterwards.
                    The study also found that people who develop PTSD after a medical event are less likely to stay on
                    the treatment regimen that they need to get better.
                    You don't need to have a serious condition to develop PTSD. Even a minor illness or surgery can be
                    traumatic if it upsets you.
                    It's possible to develop PTSD if you keep thinking about and reliving a medical event and if you
                    feel like you're still in danger after the problem has passed.
                    If you find yourself worried and anxious weeks after a medical event has subsided, you may want to
                    talk with a healthcare professional about being screened for PTSD.
                </p>
                <h4> Postpartum PTSD </h4>
                <p>
                    Childbirth is normally a happy time, but for some new moms, it can be a challenging experience.
                    According to a 2018 study, up to 4 per cent of women experience PTSD after the birth of their child.
                    Women who have pregnancy complications or who give birth too early are more likely to get PTSD.
                    You're at higher risk for postpartum PTSD if you:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li> don't have a support network </li>
                    <li> had a bad experience with a past pregnancy </li>
                    <li> are afraid of childbirth </li>
                    <li> have depression </li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    Having PTSD can make it harder for you to care for your new baby. If you have symptoms of PTSD after
                    the birth of your child, it's a good idea to see a healthcare professional for an evaluation.
                </p>
                <h4> PTSD diagnosis </h4>
                <p>
                    There's no specific test to diagnose PTSD. It can be difficult to diagnose because people with the
                    disorder may be hesitant to recall or discuss the trauma, or their symptoms.
                    The symptoms of PTSD may also mirror those of other mental health conditions, such as panic
                    disorder.
                    A mental health professional, such as a psychiatrist, psychologist, or psychiatric nurse
                    practitioner, is best qualified to diagnose PTSD.
                    To be diagnosed with PTSD, you must experience all of the following symptoms for 1 month or longer:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li> at least two cognition and mood symptoms </li>
                    <li> at least two arousal and reactivity symptoms </li>
                    <li> at least one avoidance symptom </li>
                    <li> at least one re-experience symptom </li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    Symptoms must be serious enough to interfere with your daily activities, which can include going to
                    work or school, or being around friends and family members.
                </p>
                <h4> Types of PTSD </h4>
                <p>
                    PTSD is one condition, but some experts break it down into subtypes depending on a person's
                    symptoms, also known as condition “specifiers,” to make it easier to diagnose and treat.
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li> <b> Comorbid PTSD </b> involves symptoms of PTSD, along with other mental health disorders like
                        depression, panic disorder, or a substance abuse problem. People with this type get the best
                        results from treating both PTSD and other mental health issues. </li>
                    <li> <b> Uncomplicated PTSD </b> is when you have PTSD symptoms like re-experiencing the traumatic
                        event and avoiding people and places related to the trauma, but you don't have any other mental
                        health issues such as depression. People with the uncomplicated subtype often respond well to
                        treatment. </li>
                    <li> <b> Dissociative PTSD </b> is when you detach yourself from the trauma. You feel separated from
                        the event or like you're outside of your own body. </li>
                    <li> <b> Acute stress disorder (ASD) is not PTSD. </b> It's a cluster of symptoms like anxiety and
                        avoidance that develop within a month after a traumatic event. Many people with ASD go on to
                        develop PTSD. </li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    Other specifiers include:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li> <b> “With delayed expression” </b> means a person doesn't meet full PTSD criteria until at
                        least 6 months after the event. Some symptoms may occur immediately but not enough for a full
                        PTSD diagnosis to be made. </li>
                    <li> <b> “With derealization” </b> means a person feels emotionally and physically detached from
                        people and other experiences. They have trouble understanding the realities of their immediate
                        surroundings. </li>
                </ul>
                <h4> Complex PTSD </h4>
                <p>
                    Many of the events that trigger PTSD — like a violent attack or car accident — happen once and are
                    over. Others, like sexual or physical abuse at home, human trafficking, or neglect can continue for
                    many months or years.
                    Complex PTSD is a separate but related term used to describe the emotional repercussions of
                    continued and long-term trauma, or multiple traumas.
                    Chronic trauma can cause psychological damage even more severe than that of a single event. It
                    should be noted that considerable debate exists among professionals as to the diagnostic criteria
                    for complex PTSD.
                    People with the complex type may have other symptoms in addition to the typical PTSD symptoms, such
                    as uncontrollable feelings or negative self-perception.
                </p>
                <h4> PTSD risk factors </h4>
                <p>
                    Certain traumatic events are more likely to trigger PTSD, including:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li> disasters </li>
                    <li> accident </li>
                    <li> assault </li>
                    <li> sexual violence </li>
                    <li> childhood abuse </li>
                    <li> military combat </li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    Not everyone who lives through a traumatic experience gets PTSD.
                    Other factors that may also increase your risk for PTSD include:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li> family members with PTSD </li>
                    <li> being assigned female at birth </li>
                    <li> a job that increases your exposure to traumatic events, such as police officer, military
                        member, or first responder </li>
                    <li> a lack of support </li>
                    <li> substance misuse </li>
                    <li> depression and other mental health issues </li>
                </ul>
                <h4> PTSD complications </h4>
                <p>
                    PTSD can interfere with every part of your life, including your work and relationships.
                    It can increase the risk of:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li> suicidal thoughts or actions </li>
                    <li> anxiety </li>
                    <li> depression </li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    Some people with PTSD turn to drugs and alcohol to cope with their symptoms. While these methods may
                    temporarily relieve negative feelings, they don't treat the underlying cause. They can even worsen
                    some symptoms.
                    If you've been using substances to cope, your therapist may recommend a program to help reduce your
                    dependence on drugs or alcohol.
                </p>
                <h4> PTSD dreams </h4>
                <p>
                    When you have PTSD, sleep may no longer be a restful time. Most people who've lived through intense
                    trauma have trouble falling asleep or sleeping through the night.
                    Even when you do fall asleep, you may have nightmares about the traumatic event. One study from 2018
                    explains that nightmares are “the hallmark” of PTSD. This means they are one of the most defining
                    symptoms.
                    PTSD-related bad dreams are sometimes called replicative nightmares. They can happen a few times a
                    week, and they may be even more vivid and upsetting than typical bad dreams.
                </p>
                <h4> PTSD and depression </h4>
                <p>
                    These two conditions often go hand in hand. Having depression increases your risk for PTSD and vice
                    versa.
                    Many of the symptoms overlap, which can make it hard to figure out which one you have. Symptoms
                    common to both PTSD and depression include:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li> trouble sleeping </li>
                    <li> loss of interest in activities </li>
                    <li> emotional outbursts </li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    Some of the same treatments can help with both PTSD and depression.
                </p>
                <h4> Coping with PTSD </h4>
                <p>
                    Psychotherapy is an important tool to help you cope with PTSD symptoms. It can help you identify
                    symptom triggers, manage your symptoms, and face your fears. Having your support network to lean on
                    is extremely helpful, too.
                    Learning about PTSD will help you understand your feelings and how to effectively deal with them.
                    Prioritizing health-promoting activities and your well-being can also help with the symptoms of
                    PTSD.
                    This includes:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li> limiting exposure to situations or people that increase stress or anxiety, as often as possible
                    </li>
                    <li> getting regular exercise </li>
                    <li> getting enough quality rest and sleep </li>
                    <li> eating a nutrient-rich, balanced diet </li>
                </ul>
                <h4> Support groups </h4>
                <p>
                    Support groups can provide a safe space to discuss your feelings with others with PTSD. This can
                    help you understand that your symptoms are not unusual and that you're not alone.
                </p>
                <h4> Living with someone who has been diagnosed with PTSD </h4>
                <p>
                    PTSD does not only affect the person who has it. It can also affect those around them.
                    The emotions, such as anger and fear, that people with PTSD are often challenged with can strain
                    even the strongest relationships.
                    Learning all you can about PTSD can help you be a better advocate and supporter for your loved one.
                    Joining a support group for family members or caretakers of people living with PTSD can give you
                    access to helpful tips from people who've been or are currently in your shoes.
                    Try to make sure that your loved one is getting proper treatment which can include therapy,
                    medication, or a combination of the two.
                    Also, try to recognize and accept that living with someone who has PTSD can present challenges.
                    Reach out for caregiver support if you feel the need to do so. Therapy is available to help you work
                    through your challenges which may include frustration and worry.
                </p>
                <h4> PTSD prevention </h4>
                <p>
                    Unfortunately, there's no way to foretell and prevent the traumatic events that can lead to PTSD.
                    But if you've survived one of these events, there are a few things you can do to help protect
                    yourself from flashbacks and other symptoms.
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li> <b> Helping other people heal </b> from a traumatic life event may help you bring meaning to
                        the trauma you experienced, which can also help you heal. </li>
                    <li> <b> Try to reframe </b> the way you think about a difficult situation. For example, think about
                        and see yourself as a survivor, not a victim. </li>
                    <li> <b> Having a strong support system </b> may help prevent PTSD. Lean on the people you trust
                        most, which may be your partner, friends, siblings, or a trained therapist. When your experience
                        weighs heavily on your mind, talk about it with those in your support network. </li>
                </ul>
                <h4> When to get help for PTSD </h4>
                <p>
                    If you're experiencing symptoms of PTSD, know that you're not alone. According to the National
                    Center for PTSD, about 15 million U.S. adults have PTSD in any given year.
                    If you have frequent upsetting thoughts, are unable to manage your actions, or fear that you might
                    hurt yourself or others, seek help right away.
                </p>
                <h4> Endgame </h4>
                <p>
                    If you're living with PTSD, you're not alone, and you're a survivor. You have lived through a
                    traumatic event, but it's having lasting consequences.
                    Proper treatment can help relieve your symptoms. It can also give you effective strategies for
                    coping with intrusive thoughts, memories, and flashbacks.
                    Through therapy, support groups, and medication, you can get yourself on the road to recovery.
                    Leaning on people who care about you is another good way to find support and strength on that road.
                    Always keep in mind that you're not alone. Support is available if and when you need it.

                <h3> Schizophrenia </h3>
                <p>
                    Schizophrenia is a chronic mental health condition. The cause of schizophrenia is unknown but
                    researchers believe it may be caused by a combination of biological, genetic, and environmental
                    factors.
                    Schizophrenia is a chronic psychiatric disorder. People with this disorder experience distortions of
                    reality, often in the form of delusions or hallucinations.
                    Although exact estimates are difficult to obtain, schizophrenia affects less than 1 per cent of the
                    population.
                    Misconceptions about this disorder are common. For example, some people think schizophrenia creates
                    a “split personality.” Schizophrenia and split personality — properly termed dissociative identity
                    disorder — are two different disorders.
                    Schizophrenia can occur in men and women of all ages. Men often develop symptoms in their late teens
                    or early 20s. Women tend to show signs in their late 20s and early 30s.
                </p>
                <h4> Symptoms of schizophrenia </h4>
                <p>
                    Symptoms of schizophrenia may include the following:
                </p>
                <h4> Early symptoms </h4>
                <p>
                    Symptoms of this disorder commonly show up in the teenage years and early 20s. At these ages, the
                    earliest signs may get overlooked because they mirror certain “typical” adolescent behaviours.
                    Early symptoms can include:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li> feeling different from others </li>
                    <li> odd ideas </li>
                    <li> vague suspiciousness </li>
                    <li> anxiety </li>
                    <li> difficulties with schoolwork, or poor academic performance </li>
                    <li> irritability and agitation </li>
                    <li> sleep problems </li>
                    <li> a change in focus and concentration </li>
                    <li> changing friends or social groups </li>
                    <li> isolating oneself from friends and family </li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    When it comes to more advanced symptoms, these tend to fall into three distinct categories: positive
                    symptoms, negative symptoms, and disorganized symptoms.
                    The terms “positive” and “negative” have different connotations here: “Positive” symptoms mean added
                    thoughts or actions to one's typical experience. “Negative” symptoms are the absence of typical
                    behaviours.
                </p>
                <h4> Positive symptoms </h4>
                <p>
                    “Positive” symptoms of schizophrenia aren't typical in individuals without schizophrenia or other
                    types of severe mental illness. These behaviours include:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li> <b> Delusions. </b> A delusion occurs when you believe something despite evidence or facts to
                        the contrary. </li>
                    <li> <b> Paranoia. </b> Paranoia is when someone is unusually distrustful of others, or firmly
                        believes they are being followed or persecuted. </li>
                    <li> <b> Hallucinations. </b> Hallucinations are experiences that appear real but are created by
                        your mind. They include seeing things, hearing voices, or smelling things that others around you
                        don't experience. </li>
                </ul>
                <h4> Negative symptoms </h4>
                <p>
                    Negative symptoms of schizophrenia interrupt a person's typical emotions, behaviours, and abilities.
                    These symptoms include:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li> difficulty completing everyday activities </li>
                    <li> difficulty beginning or following through with plans </li>
                    <li> trouble experiencing pleasure </li>
                    <li> social isolation </li>
                    <li> loss of interest or excitement for life </li>
                    <li> a lack of emotion or expressions </li>
                    <li> odd emotional responses to situations </li>
                    <li> reduction in speaking </li>
                </ul>
                <h4> Cognitive symptoms </h4>
                <p>
                    Sometimes referred to as “cognitive” symptoms, these symptoms are labelled as such because they
                    illustrate that someone is having trouble with certain cognitive or mental functions. They include:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li> disorganized thinking or speech, such as when a person changes topics rapidly when speaking or
                        uses made-up words or phrases </li>
                    <li> forgetfulness </li>
                    <li> problems learning information and using it </li>
                    <li> poor “executive functioning,” or understanding information and using it to make decisions </li>
                    <li> disorganized thinking, such as trouble focusing or paying attention </li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    Symptoms of schizophrenia can vary in severity and type and may be exasperated if an individual is
                    experiencing heightened stress, using substances, or is not taking their prescribed medications
                    correctly
                </p>
                <h4> Schizophrenia causes </h4>
                <p>
                    The exact cause of schizophrenia is unknown. Medical researchers believe several factors can
                    contribute, including:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li> genetic </li>
                    <li> environmental </li>
                    <li> biological </li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    Research currently suggests that imaging tests completed on people with schizophrenia may show
                    abnormalities in certain brain structures. Ongoing research in this area continues.
                </p>
                <h4> Risk factors </h4>
                <p>
                    Even though it's still not known what causes schizophrenia, researchers believe genetics may play a
                    role. People with a family history of schizophrenia have a higher risk of developing this disorder.
                    Other risk factors for schizophrenia may include:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li> taking mind-altering drugs in adolescence or young adulthood </li>
                    <li> living in a highly stressful situation </li>
                    <li> using mind-altering drugs </li>
                    <li> exposure to toxins, a virus, or malnutrition before birth or during infancy </li>
                </ul>
                <h4> Schizophrenia complications </h4>
                <p>
                    Schizophrenia is a serious mental illness that shouldn't be ignored or left untreated. The illness
                    increases the risk of serious complications, such as:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li> self-injury or suicide </li>
                    <li> family problems </li>
                    <li> alcohol or drug use </li>
                    <li> depression </li>
                    <li> phobias </li>
                    <li> anxiety </li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    Schizophrenia can also make it difficult to work or attend school. If you can't work or support
                    yourself financially, there's a higher risk of poverty and homelessness.
                </p>
                <h4> Schizophrenia treatments </h4>
                <p>
                    There's no cure for schizophrenia. Current treatments focus on managing or reducing the severity of
                    symptoms.
                    It’s important to get treatment from a psychiatrist or mental health professional who has experience
                    treating people with this disorder. You may also work with a social worker or a case manager, too.
                    Possible treatments include the following:
                </p>
                <h4> Medications </h4>
                <p>
                    Antipsychotic medication is the most common treatment for schizophrenia. Medication can help manage:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li> delusions </li>
                    <li> hallucinations </li>
                </ul>
                <h4> Psychosocial intervention </h4>
                <p>
                    Vocational rehabilitation can provide you with the skills you need to return to work. It may make
                    maintaining a regular job easier.
                </p>
                <h4> Family support and education </h4>
                <p>
                    If you or someone you care about has been diagnosed with schizophrenia, having support from family
                    and friends can help lower stress and create a feeling of inclusion. There are educational programs
                    available for family members that can help everyone spot the symptoms and provide support when
                    needed.
                </p>
                <h4> Schizophrenia vs. psychosis </h4>
                <p>
                    Schizophrenia and psychosis may be confused with one another, but they're not the same. One is a
                    mental health condition — the other is a symptom or group of symptoms.
                    Psychosis is one element or symptom of several mental health disorders, including schizophrenia.
                    Psychosis can also occur in people with no other symptoms of mental health issues.
                    Although psychosis can occur in people with schizophrenia, not everyone with this disorder will
                    experience psychosis. If you or someone you know is experiencing symptoms of psychosis, seek
                    treatment immediately.
                </p>
                <h4> Schizophrenia vs. bipolar disorder </h4>
                <p>
                    Schizophrenia and bipolar disorder are both chronic mental health conditions. They may share some
                    characteristics, but there are distinct differences.
                    Bipolar disorder causes strong shifts in mood. These swings switch between mania and depression.
                    During these episodes, someone with bipolar may experience hallucinations or delusions, especially
                    in a manic episode. Experiencing psychosis along with mood shifts may make completing everyday tasks
                    harder.
                    Likewise, people with schizophrenia may experience hallucinations or delusions, but they're also
                    very likely to experience disorganized thinking and speech. Unlike someone with bipolar disorder in
                    the manic phase, the symptoms of psychosis aren't accompanied by mania.
                    No medical test can determine which condition you have. Instead, your doctor may refer you to a
                    mental health professional who will perform a comprehensive psychiatric evaluation and order some
                    tests to help rule out possible medical causes. These tests could include blood tests, imaging
                    tests, and drug screening tests.
                </p>
                <h4> Schizophrenia statistics </h4>
                <ul>
                    <li> Schizophrenia is typically diagnosed in people in their late teens to early 30s. </li>
                    <li> Men tend to show symptoms earlier. They're also diagnosed earlier, between late adolescence and
                        their early 20s. </li>
                    <li> Women tend to be diagnosed later, from their early 20s to early 30s. </li>
                    <li> The disorder is more common in men than women. </li>
                    <li> Research suggests that schizophrenia occurs in less than 1 per cent of people. It affects more
                        than 21 million people around the world. </li>
                    <li> Worldwide, schizophrenia is one of the 15 most debilitating disorders. </li>
                    <li> Almost half of people with the disorder also have other mental health issues. </li>
                </ul>
                <h4> Endgame </h4>
                <p>
                    There's no real way to prevent schizophrenia. Still, identifying who's at risk and how to prevent
                    the disorder from occurring in at-risk individuals has been an important focus of researchers in
                    recent years.
                    Schizophrenia symptoms can go away for a while and then return, but it's possible to enjoy a
                    healthy, symptom-free life. Following your doctor's recommendations will improve your prognosis.
                    According to the Royal College of Psychiatrists, 3 out of every 5 people diagnosed with
                    schizophrenia will get better with treatment. To get on the road to improvement, it's important to:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li> follow your doctor's treatment plan </li>
                    <li> learn about your condition </li>
                    <li> understand the risk factors </li>
                </ul>
