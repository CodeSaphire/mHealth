                <h3> Anxiety Disorder </h3>
                <p>
                    Anxiety affects everyone in different ways. Sometimes, the feelings of fear and dread(great fear or
                    worry) don't go away or get worse over time. Here, you can learn about anxiety, who it affects, and
                    how to manage it.
                </p>
                <h4> What is anxiety? </h4>
                <p>
                    Anxiety is your body's natural response to stress. It is a feeling of fear or worry about what is to
                    come. For example, going to a job interview or giving a speech on the first day of school may cause
                    some people to feel fearful and nervous.
                    But if your feelings of anxiety are extreme, last for at least 6 months, and are interfering with
                    your life, you may have an anxiety disorder.
                </p>
                <h4> What are anxiety disorders? </h4>
                <p>
                    It's normal to feel anxious about moving to a new place, starting a new job, or taking a test. This
                    type of anxiety is unpleasant, but it may motivate you to work harder and do a better job. Ordinary
                    anxiety is a feeling that comes and goes but doesn't interfere with your everyday life.
                    In the case of an anxiety disorder, the feeling of fear may be with you all the time. It's intense
                    and sometimes debilitating(making someone very weak).
                    This type of anxiety may cause you to stop doing things you enjoy. For example, it may prevent you
                    from entering an elevator, crossing the street, or even leaving your home in extreme cases. If left
                    untreated, the anxiety will keep getting worse.
                    Anxiety disorders are the most common form of emotional disorder and can affect anyone. But,
                    according to the American Psychiatric Association, women are more likely than men to receive a
                    diagnosis of an anxiety disorder.
                </p>
                <h4> What are the types of anxiety disorders? </h4>
                <p>
                    Anxiety is an important part of several different disorders. These include:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li> <b>Panic disorder.</b> This means you experience recurring panic attacks at unexpected times.
                    </li>
                    <li> <b>Phobia.</b> This is an excessive fear of a specific object, situation, or activity. </li>
                    <li> <b>Social anxiety disorder.</b> This is an extreme fear of being judged by others in social
                        situations. </li>
                    <li> <b>Obsessive-compulsive disorder.</b> This means you have recurring irrational thoughts that
                        lead you to perform specific, repeated behaviours. </li>
                    <li> <b>Separation anxiety disorder.</b> This means you have a fear of being away from home or your
                        loved ones. </li>
                    <li> <b>Illness anxiety disorder.</b> This is anxiety about your health (formerly called
                        hypochondria). </li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    In addition, many mental health and medical conditions may feature anxiety as a symptom. These
                    include:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li> <b> Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). </b> This is anxiety following a traumatic event.
                    </li>
                    <li> <b> Major depressive disorders. </b> A strong relationship exists between depression and
                        anxiety. </li>
                    <li> <b> Chronic disease. </b> Managing conditions such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease
                        (COPD) and diabetes may result in anxiety symptoms. </li>
                    <li> <b> Inflammatory conditions. </b> </li>
                    <li> <b> Substance use disorders. </b> many people with anxiety may try to self-medicate to help
                        manage their symptoms. </li>
                    <li> <b> Chronic pain. </b> Anxiety is often found in those with chronic pain disorders. </li>
                </ul>
                <h4> What are the symptoms of anxiety? </h4>
                <p>
                    Anxiety feels different depending on the person experiencing it. Feelings can range from butterflies
                    in your stomach to a racing heart. You might feel out of control like there is no connection between
                    your mind and body.
                    You may have a general feeling of fear and worry, or you may fear a specific place or event. In some
                    cases, you may experience a panic attack.
                    Symptoms of anxiety can include:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li> anxious thoughts or beliefs that are difficult to control </li>
                    <li> restlessness </li>
                    <li> trouble concentrating </li>
                    <li> difficulty falling asleep </li>
                    <li> fatigue </li>
                    <li> irritability </li>
                    <li> unexplained aches and pains </li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    Your anxiety symptoms might be different from those experienced by someone else. That is why it is
                    essential to know how anxiety can present itself.
                </p>
                <h4> What is a panic attack? </h4>
                <p>
                    A panic attack is a feeling of intense fear that comes on suddenly and peaks within 10 to 20
                    minutes. The initial trigger of the fear can be known or unknown.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The physical symptoms can mimic a heart attack. Once you're experiencing a panic attack, the
                    symptoms may get worse if you believe you may be having a heart attack or a mental health emergency.
                    Another common fear that may worsen a panic attack is the fear that you might be judged negatively
                    if you're having an attack in public.
                    Panic attacks can vary greatly, and symptoms may differ among individuals. In addition, many
                    symptoms of anxiety don't happen to everyone, and they can change over time.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Common symptoms of a panic attack include:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li> chest pain </li>
                    <li> feeling of choking </li>
                    <li> fear of losing control </li>
                    <li> a feeling of impending doom </li>
                    <li> sweating, chills, and hot flashes </li>
                    <li> shaking </li>
                    <li> numbness and tingling of hands, feet, or face </li>
                    <li> nausea or upset stomach </li>
                    <li> shortness of breath </li>
                    <li> fear of dying </li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    When you experience repeated panic or anxiety attacks, you may have a panic disorder.
                </p>
                <h4> What causes anxiety? </h4>
                <p>
                    Experts aren't sure of the exact cause of anxiety. But a combination of factors likely plays a role.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The causes of anxiety may include:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li> situations such as surgery or occupational hazard </li>
                    <li> first degree relatives with generalized anxiety disorder </li>
                    <li> other medical issues such as depression or diabetes </li>
                    <li> environmental concerns, such as child abuse </li>
                    <li> substance use </li>
                    <li> stress </li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    In addition, researchers believe that it stems from the areas of the brain responsible for
                    controlling fear and the storing and retrieval of emotional and fear-related memories.
                </p>
                <h4> Who is at risk of anxiety disorders? </h4>
                <p>
                    With each type of anxiety, there are different risk factors. But there are some general influences,
                    including:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li> <b> Personality traits. </b> This includes shyness and nervousness in childhood. </li>
                    <li> <b> Life history. </b> This includes being exposed to negative or stressful life events. </li>
                    <li> <b> Genetics. </b> Of those who have a diagnosis of anxiety, 25 per cent have a first-degree
                        relative who also has a diagnosis of anxiety. </li>
                    <li> <b> Other health conditions. </b> Thyroid problems and other health conditions can make you
                        prone to anxiety. </li>
                    <li> <b> Stimulants. </b> Consuming caffeine, specific substances, and medications can worsen your
                        symptoms. </li>
                </ul>
                <h4> Are there tests that diagnose anxiety? </h4>
                <p>
                    A single test can't diagnose anxiety. Instead, an anxiety diagnosis requires a lengthy process of
                    physical examinations, mental health tests, and psychological questionnaires.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Some doctors or healthcare professionals may conduct a physical exam, including blood or urine tests
                    to rule out underlying medical conditions that could contribute to the symptoms you're experiencing.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Several anxiety tests and scales are also used to help a doctor assess the level of anxiety you're
                    experiencing.
                </p>
                <h4> What are treatments for anxiety? </h4>
                <p>
                    Once you've received a diagnosis of anxiety, you can explore treatment options with a doctor.
                    But treatment can help you overcome the symptoms and lead a more manageable day-to-day life.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Treatment for anxiety falls into three categories:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li> <b> Medication. </b> Doctors prescribe antianxiety and antidepressant drugs. </li>
                    <li> <b> Complemental health techniques. </b> Mindfulness, yoga, and self-management strategies such
                        as stress management are ways to treat your anxiety using alternative methods. </li>
                    <li> <b> Psychotherapy. </b> Therapy can include cognitive behavioural therapy and exposure response
                        prevention. </li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    Meeting with a therapist or psychologist can help you learn tools to use and strategies to cope with
                    stress when it occurs.
                </p>
                <h4> What natural remedies are used for anxiety? </h4>
                <p>
                    Lifestyle changes can effectively relieve some of the stress and anxiety you may cope with every
                    day. Most natural “remedies” consist of caring for your body and participating in healthy activities
                    while eliminating unhealthy ones.
                </p>
                <p>
                    These include:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li> quitting smoking cigarettes if you smoke </li>
                    <li> avoiding caffeine </li>
                    <li> avoiding alcohol </li>
                    <li> eating a healthy diet </li>
                    <li> staying active and exercising </li>
                    <li> meditating </li>
                    <li> getting enough sleep </li>
                </ul>
                <h4> Anxiety and depression </h4>
                <p>
                    If you have an anxiety disorder, you may also be experiencing depression. While anxiety and
                    depression can occur separately, it's not unusual for mental health disorders to happen together.
                    Anxiety can be a symptom of clinical or major depression. Likewise, worsening symptoms of depression
                    can become triggered by an anxiety disorder.
                    You can manage symptoms of both conditions with many of the same treatments: psychotherapy
                    (counselling), medications, and lifestyle changes.
                </p>
                <h4> How to help children with anxiety </h4>
                <p>
                    Anxiety in children is natural and expected. According to the Centers for Disease Control and
                    Prevention (CDC), 9.4% of children and adolescents ages 3 to 17 have had a diagnosis of anxiety.
                    As children grow up, they should outgrow the worries and fears they felt when they were younger. It
                    may be considered an anxiety disorder if they're afraid to be away from their parents, exhibit
                    extreme fear, and other anxiety symptoms that interfere with their day-to-day lives.
                    Anxiety in children can also become chronic and persistent, with uncontrolled anxiety leading them
                    to avoid interacting with their peers or family members.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Symptoms of an anxiety disorder in children might include:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li> stomachaches </li>
                    <li> headaches </li>
                    <li> fatigue </li>
                    <li> feelings of fear </li>
                    <li> trouble sleeping </li>
                    <li> irritability </li>
                    <li> anger </li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    Anxiety treatment for children includes cognitive behavioural therapy (talk therapy) and
                    medications.
                </p>
                <h4> How to help teens with anxiety </h4>
                <p>
                    Teenagers may have many reasons to be anxious. Tests, college visits, and first dates all pop up in
                    these important years. But teenagers who feel anxious or experience anxiety symptoms frequently may
                    have an anxiety disorder.
                    Symptoms of anxiety in teenagers may include nervousness, shyness, isolationist behaviours, and
                    avoidance. Likewise, anxiety in teens may lead to unusual behaviours.
                </p>
                <p>
                    For example, they may act out, perform poorly in school, skip social events, and even engage in
                    substance or alcohol use.
                    In some teens, depression may accompany anxiety. Diagnosing both conditions is essential so that
                    their treatment can address the underlying issues and help relieve symptoms.
                    The most common treatments for anxiety in teenagers are talk therapy and medication. These
                    treatments also help address depression symptoms.
                </p>
                <h4> Anxiety and stress </h4>
                <p>
                    Stress and anxiety are related but different. Stress is a typical and healthy reaction to an
                    identifiable event that's making you nervous, such as an upcoming test, presentation, wedding, or
                    other major change in your life.
                    Stress will go away once the trigger goes away. Anxiety, on the other hand, persists beyond any
                    trigger and may exist without a known trigger. A person may need treatment for anxiety to go away.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Both anxiety and stress respond well to physical activity, good sleep hygiene, and a well-balanced
                    diet. But if your anxiety and stress don't respond well and you feel your day-to-day functioning is
                    impaired, a mental health professional can help you determine a treatment plan.
                </p>
                <h4> Physical symptoms of anxiety </h4>
                <p>
                    When you experience symptoms of anxiety, they can manifest as physical symptoms such as:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li> insomnia </li>
                    <li> headache </li>
                    <li> stomachache </li>
                    <li> excessive sweating </li>
                    <li> dry mouth </li>
                    <li> shaking </li>
                    <li> muscle aches and tensions </li>
                    <li> heart palpitations </li>
                    <li> tiredness </li>
                    <li> dizziness </li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    Neither stress nor anxiety is always bad. Both can provide you with a boost or incentive to
                    accomplish the task or challenge before you. But if these feelings become persistent, they can begin
                    to interfere with your daily life. In that case, it's important to get treatment.
                    The long-term outlook for people with untreated depression and anxiety includes chronic health
                    issues, such as heart disease.
                </p>
                <h4> Anxiety and alcohol </h4>
                <p>
                    If you're anxious frequently, you may decide you would like a drink to calm your nerves. After all,
                    alcohol is a sedative. In addition, it can depress the activity of your central nervous system,
                    which may help you feel more relaxed.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Some people with anxiety disorders abuse alcohol or other drugs regularly to feel better, creating
                    dependency and addiction.
                    It may be necessary to treat an alcohol or drug problem before doctors can address the anxiety. But
                    chronic or long-term use can ultimately worsen the condition.
                </p>
                <h4> Can foods treat anxiety? </h4>
                <p>
                    Doctors commonly use medication and talk therapy to treat anxiety. But lifestyle changes, such as
                    getting enough sleep and regular exercise, can also help. In addition, some research suggests the
                    foods you eat may have a beneficial impact on your brain if you frequently experience anxiety.
                </p>
                <p>
                    These foods include:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li> flax and chia seeds </li>
                    <li> tryptophan </li>
                    <li> magnesium </li>
                    <li> vitamin D </li>
                    <li> turmeric </li>
                    <li> fatty fish such as mackerel and salmon </li>
                </ul>
                <h4> Anxiety prevention </h4>
                <h4> Children and teens </h4>
                <p>
                    It's not known why anxiety develops in children and teenagers. But there are excellent public health
                    approaches that work to prevent the disorder, and they include:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li> suicide prevention </li>
                    <li> mental health programs </li>
                    <li> child maltreatment prevention </li>
                    <li> youth violence prevention </li>
                    <li> bullying prevention </li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    As parents, you can communicate openly and honestly with your child while ensuring they're making
                    healthy decisions.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In addition, in cases of children and teens experiencing anxiety in response to something happening
                    within their family or in their home, it's a good idea to get family therapy. This is important
                    especially because children and teens may not find it so easy to talk about their feelings or be
                    aware of their anxiety.
                </p>
                <h4> Adults </h4>
                <p>
                    There are many ways to prevent anxiety and its symptoms. Please see the below options:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li> <b> Speak with a doctor about your medications. </b> Regularly speaking with a doctor about
                        your medications' dosing, effectiveness, and side effects ensures any health condition is
                        treated adequately and monitored for any possible anxiety-related side effects. </li>
                    <li> <b> Therapy. </b> Speaking with a therapist can help you develop more effective ways to cope
                        with fears and stress that lead to anxiety. </li>
                    <li> <b> Support groups. </b> Speaking with others is an opportunity to share coping strategies and
                        experiences. </li>
                    <li> <b> Restrict caffeine. </b> Caffeine can worsen anxiety symptoms. </li>
                    <li> <b> Stress management and mindfulness. </b> Practising stress management and mindfulness
                        prevent strain. </li>
                    <li> <b> Avoidance. </b> Avoiding people, places, and situations can lessen your stress and anxiety.
                        But this would be a short-term strategy. In the long term, it's better if you get treatment so
                        you no longer need to avoid a trigger. </li>
                </ul>
                <h4> Endgame </h4>
                <p>
                    You can treat your anxiety with medication, psychotherapy, or a combination of the two.
                    But some people who have a mild anxiety disorder, or a fear of something they can easily avoid,
                    decide to live with the condition and don't get treatment.
                    Avoiding the trigger, however, can make anxiety worse in the long term. Treatment can help you
                    overcome the need to avoid a trigger.
                    It's important to understand that anxiety disorders can be treated, even in severe cases. Although
                    anxiety usually doesn't go away, you can learn to manage it and live a happy, healthy life.
